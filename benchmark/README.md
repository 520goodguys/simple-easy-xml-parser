Attempting to find out which dahm XML parser to use!

Run the main method inside `XmlParsingBenchmark.java` and wait for the results.

At the moment we test:

- A simple XML input of two tags

Future:

- More complex tests and perhaps some discussive text about the API needed



We rely on https://github.com/google/caliper/wiki/ to do the hard work of twiddling the nobs.
